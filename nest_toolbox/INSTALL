Nest Toolbox Installation
=======================

Install as root (if you want a global install)::

	# python setup.py install

or for those without root access, install to a writable location, something like::

	$ python setup.py install --prefix=$HOME/opt/mystuff

Then you need to add the location::

    $HOME/opt/mystuff/lib/python2.5/site-packages/ 

to your PYTHONPATH or within python in your sys.path directive.

Note, here lib is replaced by `lib64` on 64 bit systems, and `python2.5` is
(obviously) replaced by your python version.

and happy days!
